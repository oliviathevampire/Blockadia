     * A dependency string must start with a combination of these prefixes, separated by "-":
     * [before, after], [required], [client, server]
     * At least one "before", "after", or "required" must be specified.
     * Then ":" and the mod id.
     * Then a version range should be specified for the mod by adding "@" and the version range.
     * The version range format is described in the javadoc here:
     * Then a ";".
     * <p>
     * If a "required" mod is missing, or a mod exists with a version outside the specified range,
     * the game will not start and an error screen will tell the player which versions are required.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * Our example mod:
     * * depends on Forge and uses new features that were introduced in Forge version 14.21.1.2395
     * "required:forge@[14.21.1.2395,);"
     * <p>
     * 1.12.2 Note: for compatibility with Forge older than 14.23.0.2501 the syntax must follow this older format:
     * "required-after:forge@[14.21.1.2395,);"
     * For more explanation see https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/4918
     * <p>
     * * is a dedicated addon to mod1 and has to have its event handlers run after mod1's are run,
     * "required-after:mod1;"
     * * has optional integration with mod2 which depends on features introduced in mod2 version 4.7.0,
     * "after:mod2@[4.7.0,);"
     * * depends on a client-side-only rendering library called rendermod
     * "required-client:rendermod;"
     * <p>
     * The full dependencies string is all of those combined:
     * "required:forge@[14.21.1.2395,);required-after:mod1;after:mod2@[4.7.0,);required-client:rendermod;"
     * <p>
     * This will stop the game and display an error message if any of these is true:
     * The installed forge is too old,
     * mod1 is missing,
     * an old version of mod2 is present,
     * rendermod is missing on the client.
